00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.740
Janmejay Mohanty: Hello, my name is,

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:17.320
Janmejay Mohanty: and uh, today I am gonna present a research paper on Safe and Natural sub game solving for imperfection information gains

3
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.680
Janmejay Mohanty: for for deep learning course.

4
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.669
Janmejay Mohanty: So hmm.

5
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.010
Janmejay Mohanty: The summary summary of this topic is that,

6
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.400
Janmejay Mohanty: unlike

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:42.659
Janmejay Mohanty: of uh and unlike perfect information games, the perfect ones cannot be solved by. I simply didn't compose that game into several sub games

8
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.910
Janmejay Mohanty: which I saw independently.

9
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:55.079
Janmejay Mohanty: Therefore we use a more intense computational matter of equilibrium search which takes all the decision

10
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.289
Janmejay Mohanty: of strategy of all game.

11
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:16.359
Janmejay Mohanty: Also, it's not possible for an in perfect information game to solve by method of the composition it's possible to get an approximately or or improving the existing solution by solving that these joining subcains.

12
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:29.169
Janmejay Mohanty: This method is commonly known as sub game solving. We introduce sub game solving methods that can be both prior techniques and theory theory as well as practical.

13
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.419
Janmejay Mohanty: So sub game solving is a major part of

14
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.479
the first

15
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.509
Janmejay Mohanty: Texas poker,

16
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.809
Janmejay Mohanty: introduction

17
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.059
Janmejay Mohanty: and perfect information games, models uh

18
00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:03.920
Janmejay Mohanty: strategic settings that may have hidden information. They have a countless application, including negotiation, cyber security, and physical security,

19
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.690
Janmejay Mohanty: and this type of games. The goal is to find a Nash equilibrium, which is a profile of strategies, one for each player

20
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.309
Janmejay Mohanty: such that no player can improve by one-sided deviating to a different strategy.

21
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:36.389
Janmejay Mohanty: Sub Game solving is a standard method for perfection, information, games for example, chess and checkers, in which a part of game is solved in an ice low isolation state.

22
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:51.239
Janmejay Mohanty: It can be achieved in perfect information games, as the exact state of game is not which allows remaining sub game to be solved independently from the rest of the game. For example,

23
00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:10.180
Janmejay Mohanty: we can discuss about chess game in chess game to determine the optimal response to the Queen. Gambit requires no knowledge of the optimal response to the Csc. Feeling and defense. This the composition was the major

24
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.610
Janmejay Mohanty: component for Ai being able to defeat of humans in chess and go.

25
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.250
Janmejay Mohanty: Oh, in this

26
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:40.690
Janmejay Mohanty: uh topic we are using Nash equilibrium approach. The Nash equilibrium is a decision making theorem within game theory that states, if they can achieve their design, outcome by not debating from their initial strategy in the Nash equilibrium. Each clear strategy is optimal,

27
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.620
Janmejay Mohanty: for example,

28
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:57.610
Janmejay Mohanty: so chairs is a zero sum game. So all Nash equilibria will lead to the same of three outcomes. White wins, black wins and drop.

29
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.450
Janmejay Mohanty: So the first thing there.

30
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:21.619
Janmejay Mohanty: The example of pointers here see, represent a chance. Node S. Is a player, two P. Two, some game dotted line between the two. P. Two nodes means that the P. Two can not,

31
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.920
Janmejay Mohanty: can't distinguish between them.

32
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.570
Janmejay Mohanty: So

33
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.750
Janmejay Mohanty: if we consider the first figure

34
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.600
Janmejay Mohanty: going to

35
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.750
Janmejay Mohanty: yeah,

36
00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:04.030
Janmejay Mohanty: the call does basic concept. The coin toss. Is it played by two players? P. One and two. A flip coin has only two possible outcomes, either head or tails,

37
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.780
Janmejay Mohanty: with equal probability.

38
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.260
Janmejay Mohanty: So to understand this problem.

39
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.880
Janmejay Mohanty: So we go by step by step.

40
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.220
Janmejay Mohanty: So

41
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.500
Janmejay Mohanty: a coin is first fled, and lands either its head or tails,

42
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.910
Janmejay Mohanty: and you can see the two outcomes,

43
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.600
Janmejay Mohanty: and

44
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:37.020
Janmejay Mohanty: only the thing is only P. One is the outcome. P. One can then choose between actions, sales, and play.

45
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.349
Janmejay Mohanty: The sales action leads to the A sub game whose details are not important. So we does remove that point.

46
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.560
Janmejay Mohanty: And

47
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.330
Janmejay Mohanty: if

48
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.199
Janmejay Mohanty: the sub-

49
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.420
Janmejay Mohanty: this

50
00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.910
Janmejay Mohanty: uh the sale, action, Okay. But the expected value of P. One

51
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.210
Janmejay Mohanty: of choosing the selection will be important.

52
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.500
Janmejay Mohanty: Fifty dollars

53
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:32.189
Janmejay Mohanty: for choose a for choosing sale. On the other hand, if the coin land scales. It is considered under key, and P. One receives an expected value of minus fifty,

54
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.690
Janmejay Mohanty: and

55
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.290
Janmejay Mohanty: if the people

56
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.320
Janmejay Mohanty: chooses to play, then P. Two has the opportunity to guess how the coin

57
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.209
Janmejay Mohanty: lend landed. If P. Two guess is correctly P. One rewards

58
00:06:49.650 --> 00:07:00.270
Janmejay Mohanty: receives a reward of minus one dollar, the figure shows reward only for p. One we choose then, but will be relevant to later sections.

59
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.930
Janmejay Mohanty: S.

60
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.629
Janmejay Mohanty: That occurs after P. One chooses

61
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.640
Janmejay Mohanty: play

62
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.370
Janmejay Mohanty: configure that shown in a figure a

63
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:28.299
Janmejay Mohanty: where P. Two to always guess heads t one would receive point fifty cents for choosing sale, and when the coin lands,

64
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:40.269
Janmejay Mohanty: head lands, heads and dollar one for using play when it lands This this would result in an average of point. Seven point seventy, five cents for

65
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:51.020
Janmejay Mohanty: always guesses. Yes, tails even go to receive dollar one for choosing play

66
00:07:51.380 --> 00:08:05.760
Janmejay Mohanty: when it lands heads and minus fifty cents for choosing sale when it lands sales. This will result in an average reward of point, a a result of twenty, five cents for player, one

67
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:16.499
Janmejay Mohanty: Our player, two would do even better by guessing heads, with twenty-five percent priority, and ten entails with seventy five percent providing. In this case

68
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.690
Janmejay Mohanty: even

69
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:27.920
Janmejay Mohanty: the player one could only receive fifty cents on an average by choosing play when the coin lands heads the same value for choosing sale.

70
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:41.820
Janmejay Mohanty: Now, if we go to the next part, some notation backgrounds in an imperfect information, extensive form game, there is a finite set of layers.

71
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.010
Janmejay Mohanty: There's

72
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.319
Janmejay Mohanty: uh B.

73
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:56.779
Janmejay Mohanty: H. Is a capital. H. Is a set of all possible to history, is not in the game tree represented as a sequence of actions, and includes the empty history.

74
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:16.469
Janmejay Mohanty: A bracket edge is the actions uh level in a history, and P. H. Record Edge belongs to Ftelp, uh Union, c. Is the player who acts as at the history where C. Denotes the chance history as dash

75
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:34.980
Janmejay Mohanty: it's one I's just at least after an action is taken in small edge, is a child of small edge, represented by a small. It's a dot or a small edge in small, a equal to small edge dash, while small edge is the parent or smallest dash.

76
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.450
Janmejay Mohanty: Oh, what is masical room again? Here we can see the equation.

77
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.019
Janmejay Mohanty: We try to understand, and is a strategic profile all for

78
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.250
Janmejay Mohanty: since uh of

79
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.289
Janmejay Mohanty: row star such that for for all I

80
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:10.700
Janmejay Mohanty: ui is a belong ui bracket roo, I star comma rho minus I star equal to Max Rose. Dash belongs to Sigma till I

81
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.860
Janmejay Mohanty: summation of I. New ui

82
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.350
Janmejay Mohanty: bracket

83
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:27.520
Janmejay Mohanty: Rose Star, I minus the comma roast or minus sign for two player zero. Some games, all Nash equilibrium gave identical expected values for a player.

84
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.660
Janmejay Mohanty: Wait a second.

85
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:47.620
Janmejay Mohanty: Yeah. Right prior. Now we take the look on the prior approach to some game solving in perfect confirmation games,

86
00:10:47.850 --> 00:11:03.789
Janmejay Mohanty: as the figure states uh is from the crunk strategy we refer to in the game of going to the cell. Election leads to a sub game that is not dis displayed. Priorities are shown for all the action, as you can see, since both

87
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:15.449
Janmejay Mohanty: the two nodes share an information set, the priorities over actions for each node must be identical. The counterfeitual best response value of each P. One

88
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.260
Janmejay Mohanty: action is also shown,

89
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.250
Janmejay Mohanty: so we can discuss how it works

90
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.020
Janmejay Mohanty: to shown in figure. Two

91
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:50.690
Janmejay Mohanty: has already computed four point to us, in which P. One chooses the three fourth of the time with heads and half of the time with tails and layer, two chooses heads half of the time tails one fourth of the time, and for fit one fourth of

92
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.780
Janmejay Mohanty: the time after player one chooses play, play.

93
00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:10.549
Janmejay Mohanty: The details of the trunk strategy in the cell cell sub game are not relevant in this section, but expected value for choosing the sale. Action is relevant. We assume that if clear one choose the sale election and

94
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:30.529
Janmejay Mohanty: played optimally. Uh, thereafter. Then we she she would receive an expected pay of four point five. If the going is heads and minus zero point, five is the coin scales we will attempt to improve place to ready in the sub game as that follows. P. One chooses

95
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.090
Janmejay Mohanty: everyone chooses

96
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.670
Janmejay Mohanty: choosing.

97
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.979
Janmejay Mohanty: Here is the unsafe sub game solving

98
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:48.219
Janmejay Mohanty: Uh: this video shows that the augmented sub game solved by unsafe subgame solving to determine that P. Two square Tg:

99
00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:11.930
Janmejay Mohanty: Okay, So here the unsafe subgame, solving, lax, theoretical solution quality the ent is, and there are many situation where it performs extremely poorly, because it makes strong assumptions about the one strategy outside, as

100
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:30.449
Janmejay Mohanty: that may not be true. Indeed, if it were applied to the trunk strategy of Guantos, it would produce a strategy in which P. Two always chooses heads which P. One could exploit several severely by only choosing play with,

101
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:43.390
Janmejay Mohanty: despite the lack of theoretical guarantees and potential bad performance. Unsafe Sub game. Solving is simple, and sometimes produce low, exploitable strategies, as we show later,

102
00:13:48.350 --> 00:14:03.520
Janmejay Mohanty: sub-game re-solving approach. You can see here, this video shows that dogman dates sub game used by resolving to determine a P. To strategy in the display sub game of coin to us.

103
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:15.949
Janmejay Mohanty: Clearly, here we can see clearly your own cannot do worse than and always speaking action a dash t

104
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.850
Janmejay Mohanty: which awarded awards

105
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.520
Janmejay Mohanty: uh

106
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:27.400
Janmejay Mohanty: the expected value as P. One playing a best response against new tools

107
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:43.209
Janmejay Mohanty: from strategy. But we one all the way also cannot do better than always taking a a dash team because you two could simply play according to the trunk strategy in S, which means the action a dash

108
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:52.379
Janmejay Mohanty: as would give the same expected value to P. One as X and A. Ds. T. If we one played optimally in S.

109
00:14:52.700 --> 00:15:01.720
Janmejay Mohanty: In this way the strategy for P. Two and S is pressure to be no worse than that of drunk

110
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:20.179
Janmejay Mohanty: strategy in an example, game coin to us. If player too well to always choose heads, as was the cause in unsafe subgame to solving, then t one would always choosing a Sd. With hands and a desk as retails.

111
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:36.259
Janmejay Mohanty: Oh, what is Max? Nor in solving it's not in solving measure, is similar to resolving, Accept It seeks to improve place to strategy in the sub game strategy as much as possible while

112
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:50.449
Janmejay Mohanty: resolving six for a strategy for player, two in S. That will simply prevent me one player, one from entering as Max Margin margin, solving additionally six to punish

113
00:15:50.460 --> 00:16:17.680
Janmejay Mohanty: labor, one as much as possible. If player, one nevertheless chooses to enter as a sub game margin is defined for each info set in S uh r, which represent the difference in value between entering the sub game versus choosing the alternative payoff. The same game margin is M. Rose to S. I comma as equal to v

114
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:33.030
Janmejay Mohanty: power a row for power as we are. I comma a star, a S. P. Minus V. For row os bracket. I comma a D. S.

115
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.430
Janmejay Mohanty: Well,

116
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.860
Janmejay Mohanty: here we discuss about solving multiple

117
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.200
Janmejay Mohanty: sub games independent.

118
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.910
Janmejay Mohanty: So In this figure we see that C is the left left part the game

119
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.000
Janmejay Mohanty: with two sub games, the North Sea one, and

120
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:09.850
Janmejay Mohanty: see to our public uh chances chance notes, whose outcomes are seen by both player one and player to write an augmented sub game for one of the sub-game. If

121
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:18.050
Janmejay Mohanty: only one of the sub-games is being solved, then the alternative payoffs for heads can be at

122
00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:21.349
Janmejay Mohanty: most one are in both

123
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.579
Janmejay Mohanty: uh solved independently, then the

124
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.300
Janmejay Mohanty: some to

125
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:38.640
Janmejay Mohanty: at most one. For example, the alternative payoff in both sub names can be

126
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.260
Janmejay Mohanty: point five.

127
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:49.569
Janmejay Mohanty: Yeah. To address this issue. We make two changes. First, we ensure that we do not double count gifts

128
00:17:49.580 --> 00:18:03.949
Janmejay Mohanty: That play player one gives us by using an entire gift in multiple sub-game. For example, consider the game shown in figure five, which contains two sub games s one and s two. The sale action leads to an

129
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:12.549
Janmejay Mohanty: expected value of point. Five and heads. State, while play leads to an expected value of point of zero

130
00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:23.339
Janmejay Mohanty: when solving. Just for we think that some sub came from heads because, due to the chance node, it would in only increase there once

131
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:36.590
Janmejay Mohanty: value for choosing play by zero point five. But if the same reasoning is applied to those sub games independently, then both sub games would always choose tails and player ones uh

132
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:47.410
Janmejay Mohanty: value for choosing play, or from, as would become fun, while the value for sale would would only be zero point five.

133
00:18:50.130 --> 00:19:07.439
Janmejay Mohanty: Now we will discuss about modeling error in sub games. So when solving multiple player two sub games, there is a minimal, minimally exploitable strategy row power to that could in

134
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:26.110
Janmejay Mohanty: uh being computed by changing only the strategies in the Sub Games Road Road to may not be a Nash equilibrium, because place to strategy outside the sub games is face, but it is closes that can be achieved by

135
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.019
Janmejay Mohanty: strategy only in the sub games.

136
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:47.090
Janmejay Mohanty: How a road road to can only be guaranteed to be produced by solving all sub games together because the optimal strategy in one sub game depends on the optimal strategy and other subgames

137
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.560
Janmejay Mohanty: yeah distributional alternative payoffs.

138
00:19:51.670 --> 00:20:00.180
Janmejay Mohanty: We can see in this figure the visualization of the change in augmented sub-game from figure four. When

139
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.340
Janmejay Mohanty: uh using

140
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.729
Janmejay Mohanty: distributional alternative payoffs

141
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.080
Janmejay Mohanty: so

142
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.749
Janmejay Mohanty: we can discuss it in more details like

143
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.459
Janmejay Mohanty: Well, yeah.

144
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:29.970
Janmejay Mohanty: So this modification makes the augmented sub game infinite in size, because the random variables may be real valued and player, one could have a units strategy for each outcome of random variable. Fortunately, the special

145
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:43.699
Janmejay Mohanty: uh structure of the game allows us to arrive at E. To Nash Equilibrium Strategy for this in finite size augmented subcommittee by solving a much simpler gadget game.

146
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:57.050
Janmejay Mohanty: Here are some experiments. The result we get by performing all those uh methods and techniques which we you know we have been talking about earlier

147
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:07.930
Janmejay Mohanty: uh this table, so the exploit will be evaluated in the game with no information, abstraction, or sub games, solving in small flop. Texas hold them

148
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.010
Janmejay Mohanty: uh

149
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.690
Janmejay Mohanty: this table to X shows that that

150
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:22.819
Janmejay Mohanty: exploitability evaluated in this game with no information abstraction of sub-game solving in large block Texas hold them.

151
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.049
Janmejay Mohanty: Yeah. This table three results

152
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:35.980
Janmejay Mohanty: is showing that exploitability evaluated in the game with no information. Abstraction of sub game solving intern Texas for them.

153
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.360
Janmejay Mohanty: Yeah.

154
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.569
Janmejay Mohanty: This table for results showing

155
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:58.600
Janmejay Mohanty: comparison of various sub game solving techniques in nested sub game, solving the performance of the pseudo harmonic action. Translation is also on shown. Exploritivity is evaluated in the large action, abstraction, and there is no information at section in this experiment.

156
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:09.009
Janmejay Mohanty: Here is the Lastly, we want to show you the evaluation against top humans. This this graph shows that

157
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:22.860
Janmejay Mohanty: uh liberators we talked about that El Gay, uh engine game has a performance over the course of the two thousand and seventeen brain versus Ai competition.

158
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.759
Janmejay Mohanty: So we can finally conclude,

159
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:37.849
Janmejay Mohanty: as we introduce this. How small it is! Uh introduce a

160
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:43.489
Janmejay Mohanty: Oh, here is a mistake. Sorry for that. The introduce a sub game

161
00:22:44.540 --> 00:23:04.430
Janmejay Mohanty: solving method for imperfect information games which has stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance than prior sub game. At solving matters we show, we we show results on exploitability for both safe and unsafe subgame solving matters.

162
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:23.379
Janmejay Mohanty: We also discussed and used a method for some for nested subgame, solving in response to the opponents of three actions, and demonstrated that it leads to a dramatically better performance than usual approach of actions.

163
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:32.539
Janmejay Mohanty: Finally, we showed the effectiveness of this method in practical against top human professionals in the

164
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:43.469
Janmejay Mohanty: game of heads up no limit. Texas hold them for for the main benchmark challenge for Ai in imperfect information games,

165
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:56.970
Janmejay Mohanty: and lastly, in two thousand and seventeen prints versus Ai competition. Our Ai liberators become the first Ai to reach the milestone of defeating talk Humans

166
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.410
Janmejay Mohanty: in heads up no limit. Texas holding.

167
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:09.440
Janmejay Mohanty: Thank you for listening to listening and seeing my presentation. I hope you like it.

168
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:10.960
Janmejay Mohanty: Thank you,
